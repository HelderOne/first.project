Один из лучших способов делать это — регулярно и вдумчиво читать.\r\nпольза чтения\r\n\r\nСегодня люди слишком заняты и все реже находят время для чтения. Ведь намного проще отдыхать, взяв в руки пульт от телевизора, включив смартфон или открыв ноутбук, погрузившись в виртуальную реальность. Однако у людей читающих выше шанс построить успешную карьеру, лучшие отношения в семье, они выглядят моложе и дольше живут.\r\n\r\nВот еще 10 причин, почему читать книги полезно:\r\n1. Чтение книг увеличивает словарный запас\r\n\r\nКогда вы читаете произведения разных жанров, то сталкиваетесь со словами, которые обычно не используются в повседневной речи. Если какое-то слово вам незнакомо, совсем не обязательно искать в словаре его определение. Иногда о значении термина можно понять по содержанию. Чтение помогает не только в увеличении словарного запаса, но и повышает вашу общую грамотность.\r\n2. Чтение помогает общаться с людьми\r\n\r\nЗа счет чтения повышается не только грамотность, но и ваши речевые навыки — способность четко, ясно и красиво формулировать свои мысли. Уже после прочтения нескольких классических произведений в вас повысится талант рассказчика. Вы станете более интересным собеседником, производя особенно большое впечатление на тех людей, которые не читают вообще.\r\n3. Чтение добавляет уверенности\r\n\r\nЧтение книг делает нас более уверенными. Когда в разговоре мы демонстрируем высокую эрудицию и глубокое знание того или иного предмета, то невольно ведем себя более уверенно и собранно. А признание окружающими ваших познаний положительно сказывается на самооценке.\r\n4. Чтение снижает стресс\r\n\r\nВ современном мире избавления от стресса — основная забота многих людей. Богатство и ритмика книжного текста имеет свойство успокаивать психику и освобождать организм от стресса. Особенно помогает в этом регулярное чтение перед сном.\r\n5. Чтение развивает память и мышление\r\n\r\nОдно из важных преимуществ чтения книг — это тот положительный эффект, который оно оказывает на наше мышление. При чтении мы больше рассуждаем, чтобы понять ту или иную идею произведения. Мы обычно представляем много деталей: персонажей, их одежду, окружающие предметы. Также необходимо помнить множество вещей, которые нужны для понимания произведения. Это тренирует память и логику.\r\n6. Чтение защищает от болезни Альцгеймера\r\n\r\nПо данным научных исследований, чтение действительно защищает от заболеваний мозга. Когда вы читаете, активность мозга увеличивается и постоянно находится в тонусе, что улучшает его состояние.\r\n7. Чтение делает моложе\r\n\r\nДавно доказано, что организм человека стареет быстрее, когда стареет мозг. Чтение заставляет ваш мозг постоянно работать, в результате ваша старость отодвигается.\r\n8. Чтение делает нас более творческими\r\n\r\nКреативные люди могут генерировать сразу несколько отличных идей. Откуда их можно взять? Из книг. Читая произведение, вы можете почерпнуть оттуда массу идей, которые впоследствии воплотить в жизнь.\r\n9. Чтение улучшает сон\r\n\r\nЕсли вы систематически будете читать перед сном, то вскоре организм привыкнет к этому, и тогда чтение станет своеобразным сигналом для организма, который говорит о скором отходе ко сну. Таким образом вы не только улучшите свой сон, но и утром будете чувствовать себя бодрее.\r\n10. Чтение улучшает концентрацию\r\n\r\nПри чтении необходимо сконцентрироваться на содержании произведения, не отвлекаясь на посторонние предметы. Этот навык очень полезен при любой другой деятельности.

  Parameters: {"authenticity_token"=>"[FILTERED]", "post"=>{"title"=>"Литература — это самый приятный способ игнорировать жизнь. ", "summary"=>"Чтение может быть опасным.", "body"=>"Ученые давно выяснили как сохранить ясность ума на протяжении всей жизни: нужно постоянно развивать свой мозг. Один из лучших способов делать это — регулярно и вдумчиво читать.\r\nпольза чтения\r\n\r\nСегодня люди слишком заняты и все реже находят время для чтения. Ведь намного проще отдыхать, взяв в руки пульт от телевизора, включив смартфон или открыв ноутбук, погрузившись в виртуальную реальность. Однако у людей читающих выше шанс построить успешную карьеру, лучшие отношения в семье, они выглядят моложе и дольше живут.\r\n\r\nВот еще 10 причин, почему читать книги полезно:\r\n\r\n1. Чтение книг увеличивает словарный запас\r\n\r\nКогда вы читаете произведения разных жанров, то сталкиваетесь со словами, которые обычно не используются в повседневной речи. Если какое-то слово вам незнакомо, совсем не обязательно искать в словаре его определение. Иногда о значении термина можно понять по содержанию. Чтение помогает не только в увеличении словарного запаса, но и повышает вашу общую грамотность.\r\n\r\n2. Чтение помогает общаться с людьми\r\n\r\nЗа счет чтения повышается не только грамотность, но и ваши речевые навыки — способность четко, ясно и красиво формулировать свои мысли. Уже после прочтения нескольких классических произведений в вас повысится талант рассказчика. Вы станете более интересным собеседником, производя особенно большое впечатление на тех людей, которые не читают вообще.\r\n\r\n3. Чтение добавляет уверенности\r\n\r\nЧтение книг делает нас более уверенными. Когда в разговоре мы демонстрируем высокую эрудицию и глубокое знание того или иного предмета, то невольно ведем себя более уверенно и собранно. А признание окружающими ваших познаний положительно сказывается на самооценке.\r\n\r\n4. Чтение снижает стресс\r\n\r\nВ современном мире избавления от стресса — основная забота многих людей. Богатство и ритмика книжного текста имеет свойство успокаивать психику и освобождать организм от стресса. Особенно помогает в этом регулярное чтение перед сном.\r\n\r\n5. Чтение развивает память и мышление\r\n\r\nОдно из важных преимуществ чтения книг — это тот положительный эффект, который оно оказывает на наше мышление. При чтении мы больше рассуждаем, чтобы понять ту или иную идею произведения. Мы обычно представляем много деталей: персонажей, их одежду, окружающие предметы. Также необходимо помнить множество вещей, которые нужны для понимания произведения. Это тренирует память и логику.\r\n\r\n6. Чтение защищает от болезни Альцгеймера\r\n\r\nПо данным научных исследований, чтение действительно защищает от заболеваний мозга. Когда вы читаете, активность мозга увеличивается и постоянно находится в тонусе, что улучшает его состояние.\r\n\r\n7. Чтение делает моложе\r\n\r\nДавно доказано, что организм человека стареет быстрее, когда стареет мозг. Чтение заставляет ваш мозг постоянно работать, в результате ваша старость отодвигается.\r\n\r\n8. Чтение делает нас более творческими\r\n\r\nКреативные люди могут генерировать сразу несколько отличных идей. Откуда их можно взять? Из книг. Читая произведение, вы можете почерпнуть оттуда массу идей, которые впоследствии воплотить в жизнь.\r\n\r\n9. Чтение улучшает сон\r\n\r\nЕсли вы систематически будете читать перед сном, то вскоре организм привыкнет к этому, и тогда чтение станет своеобразным сигналом для организма, который говорит о скором отходе ко сну. Таким образом вы не только улучшите свой сон, но и утром будете чувствовать себя бодрее.\r\n\r\n10. Чтение улучшает концентрацию\r\n\r\nПри чтении необходимо сконцентрироваться на содержании произведения, не отвлекаясь на посторонние предметы. Этот навык очень полезен при любой другой деятельности. Также чтение книг развивает объективность и способность принимать взвешенные решения."}, "commit"=>"Update Post", "id"=>"2"}

  Parameters: {"authenticity_token"=>"[FILTERED]", "post"=>{"title"=>"Литература — это самый приятный способ игнорировать жизнь. ", "summary"=>"Чтение может быть опасным.", "body"=>"Ученые давно выяснили как сохранить ясность ума на протяжении всей жизни: нужно постоянно развивать свой мозг. Один из лучших способов делать это — регулярно и вдумчиво читать.\r\nпольза чтения\r\n\r\nСегодня люди слишком заняты и все реже находят время для чтения. Ведь намного проще отдыхать, взяв в руки пульт от телевизора, включив смартфон или открыв ноутбук, погрузившись в виртуальную реальность. Однако у людей читающих выше шанс построить успешную карьеру, лучшие отношения в семье, они выглядят моложе и дольше живут.\r\n\r\nВот еще 10 причин, почему читать книги полезно:\r\n\r\n1. Чтение книг увеличивает словарный запас\r\n\r\nКогда вы читаете произведения разных жанров, то сталкиваетесь со словами, которые обычно не используются в повседневной речи. Если какое-то слово вам незнакомо, совсем не обязательно искать в словаре его определение. Иногда о значении термина можно понять по содержанию. Чтение помогает не только в увеличении словарного запаса, но и повышает вашу общую грамотность.\r\n\r\n2. Чтение помогает общаться с людьми\r\n\r\nЗа счет чтения повышается не только грамотность, но и ваши речевые навыки — способность четко, ясно и красиво формулировать свои мысли. Уже после прочтения нескольких классических произведений в вас повысится талант рассказчика. Вы станете более интересным собеседником, производя особенно большое впечатление на тех людей, которые не читают вообще.\r\n\r\n3. Чтение добавляет уверенности\r\n\r\nЧтение книг делает нас более уверенными. Когда в разговоре мы демонстрируем высокую эрудицию и глубокое знание того или иного предмета, то невольно ведем себя более уверенно и собранно. А признание окружающими ваших познаний положительно сказывается на самооценке.\r\n\r\n4. Чтение снижает стресс\r\n\r\nВ современном мире избавления от стресса — основная забота многих людей. Богатство и ритмика книжного текста имеет свойство успокаивать психику и освобождать организм от стресса. Особенно помогает в этом регулярное чтение перед сном.\r\n\r\n5. Чтение развивает память и мышление\r\n\r\nОдно из важных преимуществ чтения книг — это тот положительный эффект, который оно оказывает на наше мышление. При чтении мы больше рассуждаем, чтобы понять ту или иную идею произведения. Мы обычно представляем много деталей: персонажей, их одежду, окружающие предметы. Также необходимо помнить множество вещей, которые нужны для понимания произведения. Это тренирует память и логику.\r\n\r\n6. Чтение защищает от болезни Альцгеймера\r\n\r\nПо данным научных исследований, чтение действительно защищает от заболеваний мозга. Когда вы читаете, активность мозга увеличивается и постоянно находится в тонусе, что улучшает его состояние.\r\n\r\n7. Чтение делает моложе\r\n\r\nДавно доказано, что организм человека стареет быстрее, когда стареет мозг. Чтение заставляет ваш мозг постоянно работать, в результате ваша старость отодвигается.\r\n\r\n8. Чтение делает нас более творческими\r\n\r\nКреативные люди могут генерировать сразу несколько отличных идей. Откуда их можно взять? Из книг. Читая произведение, вы можете почерпнуть оттуда массу идей, которые впоследствии воплотить в жизнь.\r\n\r\n9. Чтение улучшает сон\r\n\r\nЕсли вы систематически будете читать перед сном, то вскоре организм привыкнет к этому, и тогда чтение станет своеобразным сигналом для организма, который говорит о скором отходе ко сну. Таким образом вы не только улучшите свой сон, но и утром будете чувствовать себя бодрее.\r\n\r\n10. Чтение улучшает концентрацию\r\n\r\nПри чтении необходимо сконцентрироваться на содержании произведения, не отвлекаясь на посторонние предметы. Этот навык очень полезен при любой другой деятельности. Также чтение книг развивает объективность и способность принимать взвешенные решения.", "image"=>#<ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile:0x00007f566058c498 @tempfile=#<Tempfile:/tmp/RackMultipart20210703-7183-19n38kt.jpg>, @original_filename="reading_L_min.jpg", @content_type="image/jpeg", @headers="Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"post[image]\"; filename=\"reading_L_min.jpg\"\r\nContent-Type: image/jpeg\r\n">}, "commit"=>"Update Post", "id"=>"2"}

", "summary"=>"Чтение может быть опасным.", "body"=>"Ученые давно выяснили как сохранить ясность ума на протяжении всей жизни: нужно постоянно развивать свой мозг. Один из лучших способов делать это — регулярно и вдумчиво читать.\r\n\r\nВот еще 10 причин, почему читать книги полезно:\r\n\r\n1. Чтение книг увеличивает словарный запас\r\n\r\nКогда вы читаете произведения разных жанров, то сталкиваетесь со словами, которые обычно не используются в повседневной речи. Если какое-то слово вам незнакомо, совсем не обязательно искать в словаре его определение. Иногда о значении термина можно понять по содержанию. Чтение помогает не только в увеличении словарного запаса, но и повышает вашу общую грамотность.\r\n\r\n2. Чтение помогает общаться с людьми\r\n\r\nЗа счет чтения повышается не только грамотность, но и ваши речевые навыки — способность четко, ясно и красиво формулировать свои мысли. Уже после прочтения нескольких классических произведений в вас повысится талант рассказчика. Вы станете более интересным собеседником, производя особенно большое впечатление на тех людей, которые не читают вообще.\r\n\r\n3. Чтение добавляет уверенности\r\n\r\nЧтение книг делает нас более уверенными. Когда в разговоре мы демонстрируем высокую эрудицию и глубокое знание того или иного предмета, то невольно ведем себя более уверенно и собранно. А признание окружающими ваших познаний положительно сказывается на самооценке.\r\n\r\n4. Чтение снижает стресс\r\n\r\nВ современном мире избавления от стресса — основная забота многих людей. Богатство и ритмика книжного текста имеет свойство успокаивать психику и освобождать организм от стресса. Особенно помогает в этом регулярное чтение перед сном.\r\n\r\n5. Чтение развивает память и мышление\r\n\r\nОдно из важных преимуществ чтения книг — это тот положительный эффект, который оно оказывает на наше мышление. При чтении мы больше рассуждаем, чтобы понять ту или иную идею произведения. Мы обычно представляем много деталей: персонажей, их одежду, окружающие предметы. Также необходимо помнить множество вещей, которые нужны для понимания произведения. Это тренирует память и логику.\r\n\r\n6. Чтение защищает от болезни Альцгеймера\r\n\r\nПо данным научных исследований, чтение действительно защищает от заболеваний мозга. Когда вы читаете, активность мозга увеличивается и постоянно находится в тонусе, что улучшает его состояние.\r\n\r\n7. Чтение делает моложе\r\n\r\nДавно доказано, что организм человека стареет быстрее, когда стареет мозг. Чтение заставляет ваш мозг постоянно работать, в результате ваша старость отодвигается.\r\n\r\n8. Чтение делает нас более творческими\r\n\r\nКреативные люди могут генерировать сразу несколько отличных идей. Откуда их можно взять? Из книг. Читая произведение, вы можете почерпнуть оттуда массу идей, которые впоследствии воплотить в жизнь.\r\n\r\n9. Чтение улучшает сон\r\n\r\nЕсли вы систематически будете читать перед сном, то вскоре организм привыкнет к этому, и тогда чтение станет своеобразным сигналом для организма, который говорит о скором отходе ко сну. Таким образом вы не только улучшите свой сон, но и утром будете чувствовать себя бодрее.\r\n\r\n10. Чтение улучшает концентрацию\r\n\r\nПри чтении необходимо сконцентрироваться на содержании произведения, не отвлекаясь на посторонние предметы. Этот навык очень полезен при любой другой деятельности. Также чтение книг развивает объективность и способность принимать взвешенные решения."}, "commit"=>"Update Post", "id"=>"2"}

Автор: Чак Паланик ", "body"=>"\"Чего бы ты ни достиг в этой жизни, все рано или поздно станет прахом.\" \r\n\r\nГерой романа простой офисный работник, жизнь которого скучна и безрадостна. У него нет имени, но есть бессонница, группы поддержки, Марла и Тайлер. Последний полная противоположность главного героя. Для него саморазрушение - это единственное ради чего стоит жить. Их дружба приводит к созданию Бойцовского клуба, а за ним и \"Проекта Разгром\". \r\n\r\n\"Очень многие приходят в бойцовский клуб, потому что боятся сразиться с чем-то в своей жизни. После нескольких схваток они перестают бояться.\r\n\r\n\" Главный герой - безмолвная шестеренка огромной системы. Он ходит на работу, которую ненавидит, покупает красивую мебель, которая ему не нужна. Ворвавшийся в его жизнь Тайлер все это рушит. Он жаждет перемен, бунта. Я думаю, что практически в каждом из нас живет такой бунтовщик, который хочет что-то изменить. \r\n\r\n\" - Оттого, что ты засунул в жопу перо, - говорит Тайлер, - ты еще не стал павлином.\" \r\n\r\n\"Бойцовский клуб\" - это роман откровение. Это крик. Это вопль. Написано в неповторимом стиле, дерзко, грязно, откровенно. Короткие четкие фразы, как удары под дых. Мне понравилось, я под впечатлением. Я уже смотрела экранизацию и для меня это тот редкий случай, когда книга и фильм стоят на одном уровне.

  Parameters: {"authenticity_token"=>"[FILTERED]", "post"=>{"title"=>"Литература — это самый приятный способ игнорировать жизнь. ", "summary"=>"Сегодня люди слишком заняты и все реже находят время для чтения. Ведь намного проще отдыхать, взяв в руки пульт от телевизора, включив смартфон или открыв ноутбук, погрузившись в виртуальную реальность. Однако у людей читающих выше шанс построить успешную карьеру, лучшие отношения в семье, они выглядят моложе и дольше живут.", "body"=>"Ученые давно выяснили как сохранить ясность ума на протяжении всей жизни: нужно постоянно развивать свой мозг. Один из лучших способов делать это — регулярно и вдумчиво читать.\r\n\r\nВот еще 10 причин, почему читать книги полезно:\r\n\r\n1. Чтение книг увеличивает словарный запас\r\n\r\nКогда вы читаете произведения разных жанров, то сталкиваетесь со словами, которые обычно не используются в повседневной речи. Если какое-то слово вам незнакомо, совсем не обязательно искать в словаре его определение. Иногда о значении термина можно понять по содержанию. Чтение помогает не только в увеличении словарного запаса, но и повышает вашу общую грамотность.\r\n\r\n2. Чтение помогает общаться с людьми\r\n\r\nЗа счет чтения повышается не только грамотность, но и ваши речевые навыки — способность четко, ясно и красиво формулировать свои мысли. Уже после прочтения нескольких классических произведений в вас повысится талант рассказчика. Вы станете более интересным собеседником, производя особенно большое впечатление на тех людей, которые не читают вообще.\r\n\r\n3. Чтение добавляет уверенности\r\n\r\nЧтение книг делает нас более уверенными. Когда в разговоре мы демонстрируем высокую эрудицию и глубокое знание того или иного предмета, то невольно ведем себя более уверенно и собранно. А признание окружающими ваших познаний положительно сказывается на самооценке.\r\n\r\n4. Чтение снижает стресс\r\n\r\nВ современном мире избавления от стресса — основная забота многих людей. Богатство и ритмика книжного текста имеет свойство успокаивать психику и освобождать организм от стресса. Особенно помогает в этом регулярное чтение перед сном.\r\n\r\n5. Чтение развивает память и мышление\r\n\r\nОдно из важных преимуществ чтения книг — это тот положительный эффект, который оно оказывает на наше мышление. При чтении мы больше рассуждаем, чтобы понять ту или иную идею произведения. Мы обычно представляем много деталей: персонажей, их одежду, окружающие предметы. Также необходимо помнить множество вещей, которые нужны для понимания произведения. Это тренирует память и логику.\r\n\r\n6. Чтение защищает от болезни Альцгеймера\r\n\r\nПо данным научных исследований, чтение действительно защищает от заболеваний мозга. Когда вы читаете, активность мозга увеличивается и постоянно находится в тонусе, что улучшает его состояние.\r\n\r\n7. Чтение делает моложе\r\n\r\nДавно доказано, что организм человека стареет быстрее, когда стареет мозг. Чтение заставляет ваш мозг постоянно работать, в результате ваша старость отодвигается.\r\n\r\n8. Чтение делает нас более творческими\r\n\r\nКреативные люди могут генерировать сразу несколько отличных идей. Откуда их можно взять? Из книг. Читая произведение, вы можете почерпнуть оттуда массу идей, которые впоследствии воплотить в жизнь.\r\n\r\n9. Чтение улучшает сон\r\n\r\nЕсли вы систематически будете читать перед сном, то вскоре организм привыкнет к этому, и тогда чтение станет своеобразным сигналом для организма, который говорит о скором отходе ко сну. Таким образом вы не только улучшите свой сон, но и утром будете чувствовать себя бодрее.\r\n\r\n10. Чтение улучшает концентрацию\r\n\r\nПри чтении необходимо сконцентрироваться на содержании произведения, не отвлекаясь на посторонние предметы. Этот навык очень полезен при любой другой деятельности. Также чтение книг развивает объективность и способность принимать взвешенные решения.", "image"=>#<ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile:0x00007f5660842840 @tempfile=#<Tempfile:/tmp/RackMultipart20210703-7183-fw87qn.jpg>, @original_filename="reading_L_min.jpg", @content_type="image/jpeg", @headers="Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"post[image]\"; filename=\"reading_L_min.jpg\"\r\nContent-Type: image/jpeg\r\n">}, "commit"=>"Update Post", "id"=>"2"}

Автор: Фридрих Ницше", "body"=>"Рецензия на произведение Фридриха Ницше “Так говорил Заратустра”. Фридрих Ницше - один из величайших философов 19 века, чьи идеи опередили время, в котором он жил. При жизни Ницше не имел популярности, сам он называл себя философом послезавтрашнего дня. И действительно, кажется, что его творчество начинают понимать только сейчас. \r\n\r\nВ своих произведениях он беспощадно высмеивает и развенчивает значимость таких незыблемых культурных норм своего времени, как мораль, нравственность, сострадание и создает свои ценностные ориентиры для людей будущего: индивидуализм, атеизм, имморализм, воля к власти. Основываясь на его работах, можно представить себе образ автора - лидер, способный взять власть в свои руки и вести человечество к тому самому будущему, о котором он так страстно пишет. Однако в жизни Ницше был отнюдь не таким. Вопреки своим идеям о бесполезности сострадания, был человеком, который всегда готов протянуть руку помощи(по описанию его современников).\r\n\r\nСвой жизненный путь Ницше окончил в психиатрической больнице, с чем связано множество домыслов и слухов. Но тот, кто читал биографию автора, может понять основные предпосылки безумства Ницше. Его отец также страдал тяжелым психическим заболеванием, от которого умер, когда будущему философу было всего 5 лет. Также есть версия, что Ницше болел сифилисом, которым заразился в борделе и который также мог повлиять на психическое здоровье писателя.\r\n\r\nНо безумство, которое стало как бы визитной карточкой автора, не должно отвлекать нас от его основных идей. В своем произведении “Так говорил Заратустра” Ницше поднимает проблемы общества своего времени .Он считает вредящими социуму атавизмами мораль, христианство, сострадание. Мораль для философа – это высшее заблуждение, которое отвлекает человека от собственных желаний и навязывает понятия о добре и зле, которые неестественны его природе. Христианство, призывающее к смирению, вера в высший суд и отрицание зла, как неотъемлимой части человеческой природы по мнению автора являются стагнирующими факторами для дальнейшего развития общества. Отдельного внимание заслуживает отношение Ницше к состраданию. Он рассматривает сострадание как деструктивное явление, действующее заразительно угнетающим образом. Философ призывает к переоценке существующих ценностей и предлагает следующие идеи: атеизм, индивидуализм и отсутствие морали как таковой.\r\n\r\nАктуальность данного произведения заключается в том, что те ценности, которые автор считает атавизмами и ныне пронизывают общество. Данное произведение позволяет по-новому, свежим взором взглянуть на те вещи, которые окружают нас, заставляют задуматься о природе человека, добра и зла.\r\n\r\nГоворя об общей оценке произведения, нельзя не отметить великолепный писательский талант Ницше . Писатель обладает свойственным только ему стилем повествования, включающим в себя множество метафор и иносказаний, которые многие трактуют совершенно по-разному. Но является ли это только плюсом? Если рассматривать произведение с точки зрения владения письменной речью, то несомненно. Однако, этой неопределенностью воспользовались в фашистской Германии, трактуя спорные моменты в пользу существующего тогда режима. Из-за этого Ницше какое-то время не признавали и видели в его работах лишь насилие и деструктивность. Но стоит рассматривать работу философа в отрыве от исторического прошлого его произведения. Ницше внёс неоценимый вклад в культуру, оказал влияние на многих мыслителей, таких как Камю, Сартр, Юнг, Фрейд.\r\n\r\nПодводя итоги, можно сказать, что все творчество Ницше – бунт против существующего порядка. Философия Ницше отличается тем, что его произведения не имеют четкой структуры и формы, но его идеи заставляют читателя думать и каждый в них находит что-то своё. Произведение может быть рекомендовано к прочтению людям, которые имеют сформированное мировоззрение, умеющим читать между строк. Внимательный читатель будет вознаграждён множеством необычных и интересных мыслей, которые не оставят его равнодушным.\r\n", "image"=>#<ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile:0x00007f566c743690 @tempfile=#<Tempfile:/tmp/RackMultipart20210703-7183-rekrmg.png>, @original_filename="watch The Big Game!.png", @content_type="image/png", @headers="Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"post[image]\"; filename=\"watch The Big Game!.png\"\r\nContent-Type: image/png\r\n">}, "commit"=>"Create Post"}

При жизни Ницше не имел популярности, сам он называл себя философом послезавтрашнего дня. И действительно, кажется, что его творчество начинают понимать только сейчас. \r\n\r\nВ своих произведениях он беспощадно высмеивает и развенчивает значимость таких незыблемых культурных норм своего времени, как мораль, нравственность, сострадание и создает свои ценностные ориентиры для людей будущего: индивидуализм, атеизм, имморализм, воля к власти. Основываясь на его работах, можно представить себе образ автора - лидер, способный взять власть в свои руки и вести человечество к тому самому будущему, о котором он так страстно пишет. Однако в жизни Ницше был отнюдь не таким. Вопреки своим идеям о бесполезности сострадания, был человеком, который всегда готов протянуть руку помощи(по описанию его современников).\r\n\r\nСвой жизненный путь Ницше окончил в психиатрической больнице, с чем связано множество домыслов и слухов. Но тот, кто читал биографию автора, может понять основные предпосылки безумства Ницше. Его отец также страдал тяжелым психическим заболеванием, от которого умер, когда будущему философу было всего 5 лет. Также есть версия, что Ницше болел сифилисом, которым заразился в борделе и который также мог повлиять на психическое здоровье писателя.\r\n\r\nНо безумство, которое стало как бы визитной карточкой автора, не должно отвлекать нас от его основных идей.

У него нет имени, но есть бессонница, группы поддержки, Марла и Тайлер. Последний полная противоположность главного героя. Для него саморазрушение - это единственное ради чего стоит жить. Их дружба приводит к созданию Бойцовского клуба, а за ним и \"Проекта Разгром\". \r\n\r\n\"Очень многие приходят в бойцовский клуб, потому что боятся сразиться с чем-то в своей жизни. После нескольких схваток они перестают бояться.\r\n\r\n\" Главный герой - безмолвная шестеренка огромной системы. Он ходит на работу, которую ненавидит, покупает красивую мебель, которая ему не нужна. Ворвавшийся в его жизнь Тайлер все это рушит. Он жаждет перемен, бунта. Я думаю, что практически в каждом из нас живет такой бунтовщик, который хочет что-то изменить. \r\n\r\n\" - Оттого, что ты засунул в жопу перо, - говорит Тайлер, - ты еще не стал павлином.\" \r\n\r\n\"Бойцовский клуб\" - это роман откровение. Это крик. Это вопль. Написано в неповторимом стиле, дерзко, грязно, откровенно. Короткие четкие фразы, как удары под дых. Мне понравилось, я под впечатлением.

  Parameters: {"authenticity_token"=>"[FILTERED]", "post"=>{"title"=>"Литература — это самый приятный способ игнорировать жизнь. ", "summary"=>"Сегодня люди слишком заняты и все реже находят время для чтения. Ведь намного проще отдыхать, взяв в руки пульт от телевизора, включив смартфон или открыв ноутбук, погрузившись в виртуальную реальность. Однако у людей читающих выше шанс построить успешную карьеру, лучшие отношения в семье, они выглядят моложе и дольше живут.", "body"=>"Ученые давно выяснили как сохранить ясность ума на протяжении всей жизни: нужно постоянно развивать свой мозг. Один из лучших способов делать это — регулярно и вдумчиво читать.\r\n\r\nВот еще 10 причин, почему читать книги полезно:\r\n\r\n1. Чтение книг увеличивает словарный запас\r\n\r\nКогда вы читаете произведения разных жанров, то сталкиваетесь со словами, которые обычно не используются в повседневной речи. Если какое-то слово вам незнакомо, совсем не обязательно искать в словаре его определение. Иногда о значении термина можно понять по содержанию. Чтение помогает не только в увеличении словарного запаса, но и повышает вашу общую грамотность.\r\n\r\n2. Чтение помогает общаться с людьми\r\n\r\nЗа счет чтения повышается не только грамотность, но и ваши речевые навыки — способность четко, ясно и красиво формулировать свои мысли. Уже после прочтения нескольких классических произведений в вас повысится талант рассказчика. Вы станете более интересным собеседником, производя особенно большое впечатление на тех людей, которые не читают вообще.\r\n\r\n3. Чтение добавляет уверенности\r\n\r\nЧтение книг делает нас более уверенными. Когда в разговоре мы демонстрируем высокую эрудицию и глубокое знание того или иного предмета, то невольно ведем себя более уверенно и собранно. А признание окружающими ваших познаний положительно сказывается на самооценке.\r\n\r\n4. Чтение снижает стресс\r\n\r\nВ современном мире избавления от стресса — основная забота многих людей. Богатство и ритмика книжного текста имеет свойство успокаивать психику и освобождать организм от стресса. Особенно помогает в этом регулярное чтение перед сном.\r\n\r\n5. Чтение развивает память и мышление\r\n\r\nОдно из важных преимуществ чтения книг — это тот положительный эффект, который оно оказывает на наше мышление. При чтении мы больше рассуждаем, чтобы понять ту или иную идею произведения. Мы обычно представляем много деталей: персонажей, их одежду, окружающие предметы. Также необходимо помнить множество вещей, которые нужны для понимания произведения. Это тренирует память и логику.\r\n\r\n6. Чтение защищает от болезни Альцгеймера\r\n\r\nПо данным научных исследований, чтение действительно защищает от заболеваний мозга. Когда вы читаете, активность мозга увеличивается и постоянно находится в тонусе, что улучшает его состояние.\r\n\r\n7. Чтение делает моложе\r\n\r\nДавно доказано, что организм человека стареет быстрее, когда стареет мозг. Чтение заставляет ваш мозг постоянно работать, в результате ваша старость отодвигается.\r\n\r\n8. Чтение делает нас более творческими\r\n\r\nКреативные люди могут генерировать сразу несколько отличных идей. Откуда их можно взять? Из книг. Читая произведение, вы можете почерпнуть оттуда массу идей, которые впоследствии воплотить в жизнь.\r\n\r\n9. Чтение улучшает сон\r\n\r\nЕсли вы систематически будете читать перед сном, то вскоре организм привыкнет к этому, и тогда чтение станет своеобразным сигналом для организма, который говорит о скором отходе ко сну. Таким образом вы не только улучшите свой сон, но и утром будете чувствовать себя бодрее.\r\n\r\n10. Чтение улучшает концентрацию\r\n\r\nПри чтении необходимо сконцентрироваться на содержании произведения, не отвлекаясь на посторонние предметы. Этот навык очень полезен при любой другой деятельности. Также чтение книг развивает объективность и способность принимать взвешенные решения."}, "commit"=>"Update Post", "id"=>"2"}

  Parameters: {"authenticity_token"=>"[FILTERED]", "post"=>{"title"=>"Так говорил Заратустра", "summary"=>"Человек – это канат, натянутый между животным и сверхчеловеком, – канат над пропастью.\r\nДата публикации: 10 апреля 1885 г. Автор: Фридрих Ницше", "body"=>"Рецензия на произведение Фридриха Ницше “Так говорил Заратустра”. Фридрих Ницше - один из величайших философов 19 века, чьи идеи опередили время, в котором он жил. При жизни Ницше не имел популярности, сам он называл себя философом послезавтрашнего дня. И действительно, кажется, что его творчество начинают понимать только сейчас. \r\n\r\nВ своих произведениях он беспощадно высмеивает и развенчивает значимость таких незыблемых культурных норм своего времени, как мораль, нравственность, сострадание и создает свои ценностные ориентиры для людей будущего: индивидуализм, атеизм, имморализм, воля к власти. Основываясь на его работах, можно представить себе образ автора - лидер, способный взять власть в свои руки и вести человечество к тому самому будущему, о котором он так страстно пишет. Однако в жизни Ницше был отнюдь не таким. Вопреки своим идеям о бесполезности сострадания, был человеком, который всегда готов протянуть руку помощи(по описанию его современников).\r\n\r\nСвой жизненный путь Ницше окончил в психиатрической больнице, с чем связано множество домыслов и слухов. Но тот, кто читал биографию автора, может понять основные предпосылки безумства Ницше. Его отец также страдал тяжелым психическим заболеванием, от которого умер, когда будущему философу было всего 5 лет. Также есть версия, что Ницше болел сифилисом, которым заразился в борделе и который также мог повлиять на психическое здоровье писателя.\r\n\r\nНо безумство, которое стало как бы визитной карточкой автора, не должно отвлекать нас от его основных идей. В своем произведении “Так говорил Заратустра” Ницше поднимает проблемы общества своего времени .Он считает вредящими социуму атавизмами мораль, христианство, сострадание. Мораль для философа – это высшее заблуждение, которое отвлекает человека от собственных желаний и навязывает понятия о добре и зле, которые неестественны его природе. Христианство, призывающее к смирению, вера в высший суд и отрицание зла, как неотъемлимой части человеческой природы по мнению автора являются стагнирующими факторами для дальнейшего развития общества. Отдельного внимание заслуживает отношение Ницше к состраданию. Он рассматривает сострадание как деструктивное явление, действующее заразительно угнетающим образом. Философ призывает к переоценке существующих ценностей и предлагает следующие идеи: атеизм, индивидуализм и отсутствие морали как таковой.\r\n\r\nАктуальность данного произведения заключается в том, что те ценности, которые автор считает атавизмами и ныне пронизывают общество. Данное произведение позволяет по-новому, свежим взором взглянуть на те вещи, которые окружают нас, заставляют задуматься о природе человека, добра и зла.\r\n\r\nГоворя об общей оценке произведения, нельзя не отметить великолепный писательский талант Ницше . Писатель обладает свойственным только ему стилем повествования, включающим в себя множество метафор и иносказаний, которые многие трактуют совершенно по-разному. Но является ли это только плюсом? Если рассматривать произведение с точки зрения владения письменной речью, то несомненно. Однако, этой неопределенностью воспользовались в фашистской Германии, трактуя спорные моменты в пользу существующего тогда режима. Из-за этого Ницше какое-то время не признавали и видели в его работах лишь насилие и деструктивность. Но стоит рассматривать работу философа в отрыве от исторического прошлого его произведения. Ницше внёс неоценимый вклад в культуру, оказал влияние на многих мыслителей, таких как Камю, Сартр, Юнг, Фрейд.\r\n\r\nПодводя итоги, можно сказать, что все творчество Ницше – бунт против существующего порядка. Философия Ницше отличается тем, что его произведения не имеют четкой структуры и формы, но его идеи заставляют читателя думать и каждый в них находит что-то своё. Произведение может быть рекомендовано к прочтению людям, которые имеют сформированное мировоззрение, умеющим читать между строк. Внимательный читатель будет вознаграждён множеством необычных и интересных мыслей, которые не оставят его равнодушным.\r\n", "all_tags"=>"Классика, Философия"}, "commit"=>"Update Post", "id"=>"4"}

Ведь намного проще отдыхать, взяв в руки пульт от телевизора, включив смартфон или открыв ноутбук, погрузившись в виртуальную реальность. Однако у людей читающих выше шанс построить успешную карьеру, лучшие отношения в семье, они выглядят моложе и дольше живут.", "body"=>"Ученые давно выяснили как сохранить ясность ума на протяжении всей жизни: нужно постоянно развивать свой мозг. Один из лучших способов делать это — регулярно и вдумчиво читать.\r\n\r\nВот еще 10 причин, почему читать книги полезно:\r\n\r\n1. Чтение книг увеличивает словарный запас\r\n\r\nКогда вы читаете произведения разных жанров, то сталкиваетесь со словами, которые обычно не используются в повседневной речи. Если какое-то слово вам незнакомо, совсем не обязательно искать в словаре его определение. Иногда о значении термина можно понять по содержанию. Чтение помогает не только в увеличении словарного запаса, но и повышает вашу общую грамотность.\r\n\r\n2. Чтение помогает общаться с людьми\r\n\r\nЗа счет чтения повышается не только грамотность, но и ваши речевые навыки — способность четко, ясно и красиво формулировать свои мысли. Уже после прочтения нескольких классических произведений в вас повысится талант рассказчика. Вы станете более интересным собеседником, производя особенно большое впечатление на тех людей, которые не читают вообще.\r\n\r\n3. Чтение добавляет уверенности\r\n\r\nЧтение книг делает нас более уверенными. Когда в разговоре мы демонстрируем высокую эрудицию и глубокое знание того или иного предмета, то невольно ведем себя более уверенно и собранно. А признание окружающими ваших познаний положительно сказывается на самооценке.\r\n\r\n4. Чтение снижает стресс\r\n\r\nВ современном мире избавления от стресса — основная забота многих людей. Богатство и ритмика книжного текста имеет свойство успокаивать психику и освобождать организм от стресса. Особенно помогает в этом регулярное чтение перед сном.\r\n\r\n5. Чтение развивает память и мышление\r\n\r\nОдно из важных преимуществ чтения книг — это тот положительный эффект, который оно оказывает на наше мышление. При чтении мы больше рассуждаем, чтобы понять ту или иную идею произведения. Мы обычно представляем много деталей: персонажей, их одежду, окружающие предметы. Также необходимо помнить множество вещей, которые нужны для понимания произведения. Это тренирует память и логику.\r\n\r\n6. Чтение защищает от болезни Альцгеймера\r\n\r\nПо данным научных исследований, чтение действительно защищает от заболеваний мозга. Когда вы читаете, активность мозга увеличивается и постоянно находится в тонусе, что улучшает его состояние.\r\n\r\n7. Чтение делает моложе\r\n\r\nДавно доказано, что организм человека стареет быстрее, когда стареет мозг. Чтение заставляет ваш мозг постоянно работать, в результате ваша старость отодвигается.\r\n\r\n8. Чтение делает нас более творческими\r\n\r\nКреативные люди могут генерировать сразу несколько отличных идей. Откуда их можно взять? Из книг. Читая произведение, вы можете почерпнуть оттуда массу идей, которые впоследствии воплотить в жизнь.\r\n\r\n9. Чтение улучшает сон\r\n\r\nЕсли вы систематически будете читать перед сном, то вскоре организм привыкнет к этому, и тогда чтение станет своеобразным сигналом для организма, который говорит о скором отходе ко сну. Таким образом вы не только улучшите свой сон, но и утром будете чувствовать себя бодрее.\r\n\r\n10. Чтение улучшает концентрацию\r\n\r\nПри чтении необходимо сконцентрироваться на содержании произведения, не отвлекаясь на посторонние предметы. Этот навык очень полезен при любой другой деятельности. Также чтение книг развивает объективность и способность принимать взвешенные решения.", "all_tags"=>"Саморазвитие"}, "commit"=>"Update Post", "id"=>"2"}
